                    <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Gina Wiley, owner and instructor at The Dancer By Gina! I‚Äôm thrilled you are checking
                        us out and proud to say DBG has been thriving for over 30 years! Sharing my passion for dance
                        is what I still work hard on each and every day, as I‚Äôm always being inspired to create
                        choreography!!</p>
                    <p>I graduated from the Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance
                        and served as Captain on the OSU dance team! I performed with Ohio Northern University‚Äôs
                        dance department after graduating and became an adjunct faculty within their Musical Theatre
                        department, teaching Tap II and III for over 18 years. I continue to choreograph their annual
                        Holiday Spectacular, which I started with in 2003! Dancing since the age of three, I still love to
                        share this beautiful art form with my students, keeping them challenged and always having fun!
                        From countless dance conventions and classes throughout the United States to performing with
                        Rhythm-In-Shoes, Especially Tap Chicago, Gus Giordano Jazz Dance Chicago, and Los Angeles

                        In addition, I‚Äôve served as Assistant Choreographer and Associate Choreographer to ONU‚Äôs
                        spring musicals like Footloose and 42 nd Street, as well as dance team and cheer choreographer
                        for Ohio State, BGSU, ONU, and many area high schools. Dance is my life and I‚Äôm so happy

                    <p>Hi everyone! I am Ashley Etzkorn, DBG faculty member and DBG Dance Mom! üôÇ I have been involved at the Dancer by Gina for many years. I started dancing for Gina at the age of 3 and continued through High School. After graduation I was fortunate enough to join the team of faculty and recently gained the title "Dance Mom" when our daughter started dancing too! I have a passion for inspiring little ones to move! My favorite part of teaching the Mommy and Me class is watching the kids grow in confidence and explore the early stages of Dance!</p>
                    <p>Aside from DBG I am a wife and mom to our twins. My husband and I own two local flower shops, Ivy Hutch in Delphos and Fettig's in Van Wert. When I am not working or dancing you can find me eating lots of candy! üòâ</p>
                    <p>I can‚Äôt wait to dance with you!</p>

                    <h2>Dance Instructor</h2>
                    <p>Hello friends and family! I'm Kayla Kruse and I'm so lucky to be able to be a part of such an amazing dance family. I started dancing for Gina when I was 7 years old and continued throughout high school. After graduating I was grateful to become a teacher and have been teaching for over 10 years! I was on the competition team for many years and have done multiple performances including Carnival Cruise lines and Cleveland Cavaliers games! I teach a variety of classes and different styles for students of all ages, recreational and competitive classes and absolutely love every second of it! Alongside being a faculty member, I am a dance mom, and now I understand when moms say, "it's the best" because literally, "It's the best!"</p>
                    <p>The best part about being a dance instructor is watching the confidence and skill levels in young kids grow! The little ones face lights up when seeing the "big stage" for the first time and watching the older girls is a look that makes everything worth it!</p>
                    <p>While not at DBG I'm a wife and a mom to our two girls, Brayla who is 3 and Remi who is 1. My husband, Braytan and I have been together for 13 years! When I'm not at DBG we enjoy going to the lake with our Ski boat, fishing, hunting, and swimming!</p>
                    <p>Come dance with the best! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Abbey Acerro and this will be my 8th year as a DBG faculty member. I danced at the Dancer by Gina for 16 years, with 9 of those being competitive. While I was a student, I had the opportunity to perform at the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade, 7 Cleveland Cavalier halftime shows, and various other local events. I attended Bowling Green State University where I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Communications with a Minor in Dance and then continued on to earn my Master‚Äôs Degree in Business Administration. While in college, I kept dancing in a student run organization called University Dance Alliance where I got to perform and choreograph. Outside of teaching, I work as the business manager at NR Lee Restoration here in Delphos. I am a proud dog mom to Louie and Leo and I love to travel and go on adventures!</p>
                    <p>The Dancer by Gina has been my home away from home for over 20 years now, and I feel grateful everyday to be able to teach our students the thing I am most passionate about. I teach all styles, but my favorite is contemporary! In class, I strive to provide the knowledge and passion for our students to become the best dancers and individuals they can be inside and outside of the studio. The Dancer by Gina is truly a wonderful place and I can‚Äôt wait to see you all in the studio!</p>

                        as danced here for fifteen years! You may remember my character on stage as I was always
                        known for great faces and attitude! DBG has always held a special place in my heart, and I am
                        so blessed to be part of the team now. My favorite part of DBG is the community it brings. The
                        most rewarding part of dance is teaching the kids something new every week and watching
                        them grow their skills!</p>
                    <p>Outside of DBG, I work for my local Church where I get to express my love of singing. If I‚Äôm not
                        dancing or singing, you may find me at the gym working out!</p>

                        and tumbling at the Dancer by Gina at the age of 6. I will forever have amazing memories of performing

                        Cultural Exchange Program, and so much more! I continued to dance after high school, earning a dance
                        minor at Ohio Northern University. There I was able to perform in the Holiday Spectacular for three
                        years, and take master classes and perform with Taylor II, Alvin Ailey and Dayton Contemporary Dance
                        Company. I love to encourage students to be the best they can be and see their joy when they gain a
